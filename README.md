# iv-sdk
"SDK" for creating GTA IV .asi plugins

Supports 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0 (EFIGS only)

The majority of the project has been created for 1.0.8.0 and then had addresses ported to 1.0.7.0 so if there's any incompatibility on that version, feel free to report it.

There are no plans to support any other versions because of major differences in classes and functions.
